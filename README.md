# MEMORY-GAME
It is a famous memory game in which we have to remember the pattern and then enter the same pattern. I have made this on atmega 8 using 4 leds which will generate a pattern and 4 push buttons through which we can enter the pattern. I have added to additional leds one green and other one is red. If the entered pattern is right then it will glow green led and the level will increase and if the entered pattern is wrong then it will glow the red  led and the game will restart.
